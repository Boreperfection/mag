PROCEDURE MAGSYM.PRO 

AN INTERACTIVE PROCEDURE TO DISPLAY RESULTS FROM ROTATING CONVECTION,
MAGNETOCONVECTION & DYNAMO CALCULATIONS WRITTEN BY P. OLSON

USES g-files WRITTEN BY THE CODE MAG WRITTEN BY G.A.GLATZMAIER WITH 
MODIFICATIONS BY U.CHRISTENSEN AND P. OLSON 

SOME LONGITUDINAL SYMMETRY MAY BE ASSUMED IN THE g-file.

THIS VERSION USES MODIFIED IDL COLOR TABLES AND ASSUMES
FORMATTED INPUT

THIS VERSION CREATES EITHER .PS FILES OR .GIF FILES; IF OTHER
OUTPUT FILE FORMATS ARE REQUIRED, MODIFICATIONS OF "LABELOUT" ARE REQUIRED

THIS VERSION ASSUMES X-WINDOW SCREEN GRAPHICS; FOR OTHER GRAPHICS DEVICES,
CHANGE THE SET_PLOT,'X' AND TVRD() COMMANDS ACCORDINGLY

PROCEDURE MAGVOL.PRO 

AN INTERACTIVE IDL PROCEDURE TO DISPLAY VOLUME RESULTS FROM ROTATING CONVECTION,
MAGNETOCONVECTION & DYNAMO CALCULATIONS, WRITTEN BY P. OLSON

USES g-files WRITTEN BY THE CODE MAG WRITTEN BY G.A.GLATZMAIER WITH 
MODIFICATIONS BY U.CHRISTENSEN AND P. OLSON 

SOME LONGITUDINAL SYMMETRY MAY BE ASSUMED IN THE g-file.

THIS VERSION USES MODIFIED IDL COLOR TABLES AND ASSUMES
FORMATTED OR UNFORMATTED INPUT

THIS VERSION ASKS FOR .GIF BUT CREATES .JPG FILES ; IF OTHER
OUTPUT FILE FORMATS ARE REQUIRED, MODIFICATIONS OF "LABELOUT" ARE REQUIRED

THIS VERSION ASSUMES X-WINDOW SCREEN GRAPHICS; FOR OTHER GRAPHICS DEVICES,
CHANGE THE SET_PLOT,'X' AND TVRD() COMMANDS ACCORDINGLY

THIS PROCEDURE CREATES VOLUME-RENDERED IMAGES OF TEMPERATURE, HELICITY
THE Z-COMPONENT OF VORTICITY, KINETIC AND MAGNETIC ENERGY,
JOULE HEATING, WORK BY LORENTZ FORCES AND BUOYANCY FORCES

PROCEDURE MAGXY.PRO

PROCEDURE MAGXY takes data from l.fname and ls.fname created by
MAG and generates xy plots of energy time series and spectra.

PROCEDURE MAGTS.PRO

PROCEDURE MAGTS takes data from l-files generated by MAG
and creates time series plots and statistics.
This version reads an l-file consisting of 17 time series,
the first record being dimensionless time. Energies and
rms magnetic field and velocity are scaled as in MAG; tilt is dipole
vector colatitude; pole longitude is dipole vector longitude
